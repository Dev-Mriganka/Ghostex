/// CDXC:PlatformSupport 2026-09-24 WHY:
/// Linux tiling managers need transient ownership before mapping; borderless Normal windows still tile. Floating preserves outside-click dismissal and session switching, which Dialog would block. Each Linux caller supplies x11_parent explicitly.

/// GPUI gives a Linux window server-side decorations unless it asks otherwise, so KWin drew a title bar with minimize and close buttons on the chat menus, the account popover and the app modals, which all draw their own panel. Child windows opened with `child_window_kind()` and no titlebar ask for client decorations, which on X11 means no window-manager frame, the borderless window they are on macOS and Windows. Their `Root` is built with `bordered(false)`: gpui-component otherwise wraps a client-decorated window in its Linux shadow and resize edges, which shrank the menus and pushed the account popover's Add account button out of its window.

/// CDXC:PlatformSupport 2026-09-23 WHY:
/// On Windows a window opened without a display is placed against the primary monitor, and bounds that lie on another monitor fail its on-display check and are replaced by the primary monitor's default spot. With the app on a second monitor, the chat's model, mode and context window menus therefore opened somewhere else, where they looked like they were behind the main window. Every popup names the display its bounds are on.
