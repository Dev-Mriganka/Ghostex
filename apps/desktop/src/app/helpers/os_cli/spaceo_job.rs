/// CDXC:ManagedTools 2026-10-01 WHY:
/// `--no-clients` keeps the installer from registering SpaceO's MCP server with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and Claude Desktop, matching Trycua's CLI-only skill; agents use the `spaceo` CLI through `$ghostex-spaceo`.

/// SpaceO's daemon does the clicking and capturing, and a daemon started on demand takes the macOS grants of whatever started it (an agent's terminal, or Ghostex itself when started from this job, whose output pipes it would then hold open). Running it as SpaceO's own `com.spaceo.daemon` LaunchAgent gives it one stable identity to grant once, the role CuaDriver.app plays for Trycua. When the LaunchAgent already exists, an update drains the daemon (`daemon restart --operator` waits for running sessions to end) and launchd starts the new build; otherwise any hand-started daemon is stopped before the LaunchAgent takes its socket.
