//! Session chat host actions and the app modal bridge, chat drafts and attachments, and opening links and files from a chat, one sibling module per concern (each with its own `impl GhostexGpuiApp` block).

// C1 wave-4 extraction: `impl GhostexGpuiApp` methods moved verbatim out of
// main.rs (pure move; the only edit is the `pub(crate) ` visibility prefix the
// cross-module split requires). See docs/2026-08-22/repo-restructure/SPLITS.md C1.
