//! Ghostex Capture: a floating Ghostex button over every app that shows how many sessions are
//! working, waiting for the user, or asking a question, and lets the user screenshot an area, the
//! current app or the full screen, mark it up, and send a prompt to any project or session without
//! switching to Ghostex.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: apps/desktop/native/macos/GpuiGhostexCapture.m, packages/gx-core/src/indicators.rs
//! (the counts), docs/2026-09-30/ghostex-capture/ (the mockups the user approved).
