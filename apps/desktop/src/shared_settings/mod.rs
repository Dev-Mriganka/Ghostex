CDXC:Settings 2026-06-24-10:50:
GPUI must read and persist the shared sidebar settings JSON through the central XDG/GHOSTEX_HOME path resolver. Keep this module as the single GPUI path/read/write contract so Settings UI parity handles `updateSettings` without introducing a second settings store.

CDXC:Settings 2026-06-24-10:50:
Rust should parse only the GPUI runtime fields it consumes today: debuggingMode, showBetaFeatures, sidebarDefaultWidthPx, projectSwitchKeepAliveMinutes, project-editor auto-sleep fields, legacy external-IDE command fields, and the supported embedded Ghostty surface font-size field. The raw JSON object is preserved for whole-object writes, but this service intentionally does not duplicate the full TypeScript `ghostexSettings` schema.

CDXC:Settings 2026-06-24-10:50:
GPUI `updateSettings` handling needs a production write path: accept only JSON object payloads, create the shared state directory, write through an adjacent temp file then rename, skip byte-identical writes, and maintain a monotonic in-memory revision/hash/snapshot signal without logging paths, project names, URLs, commands, environment values, tokens, stdout/stderr, or user-owned content.

CDXC:Settings 2026-06-24-11:14:
The real React app-modal host now saves through GPUI, so the service exposes immutable snapshot object reads and a central object write entrypoint. Keep validation at this boundary: only object-shaped Settings payloads may persist, and callers must use the returned snapshot for post-save hydration instead of re-reading the settings file ad hoc.

CDXC:Terminal 2026-06-27-10:10:
The GPUI surface FFI contract only accepts `terminalFontSize` through `ghostty_surface_config_s`; normalize it into `font_size` and keep every other terminal Settings key out of the surface request.

CDXC:Terminal 2026-06-27-10:10:
Font family, theme, cursor, scrollback, clipboard, and mouse settings are Ghostty config-file-backed for future or recreated surfaces. `terminalPastePreviewableImages` is runtime-only and must not be included in config-file change detection or config writes.

CDXC:Terminal 2026-06-27-10:22:
GPUI image paste preview is runtime-only app behavior and defaults on for parity with `ghostex-settings.ts`. Snapshot access must accept only strict JSON booleans for `terminalPastePreviewableImages`, with missing or malformed values resolving to true.

CDXC:AgentProviders 2026-06-24-11:39:
GPUI Settings matches macOS for gxserver-owned agent launch policy: `agentAcceptAllEnabled` and `defaultPromptAgentId` remain in shared Settings only as a synchronous render cache. Parse them with the same default/normalization semantics as the TypeScript settings schema so GPUI can compare saves and reconcile gxserver canonical responses without duplicating the full settings model.

CDXC:Terminal 2026-06-24-12:24:
GPUI Settings owns a bounded Ghostty config-file writer, not an arbitrary path bridge. Select only the same Application Support config candidates used by macOS, create the preferred `com.mitchellh.ghostty/config.ghostty` file when none exist, replace only Ghostex's marked managed block, and never accept config paths from React or shared Settings JSON.

CDXC:Terminal 2026-06-24-12:24:
GPUI can write Ghostty's config file for external Ghostty reloads and future/recreated embedded surfaces, but the current GPUI GhosttyKit wrapper exposes no safe app config reload/update FFI. Do not claim live embedded terminal reload, do not drop running surfaces as a fallback, and surface file write/open failures explicitly without creating a second config file.
