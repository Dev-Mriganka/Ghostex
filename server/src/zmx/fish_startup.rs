/// CDXC:Terminal 2026-10-01 WHY:
/// Running a fish user's agent from the `/bin/zsh -lic` script shell gave it zsh's PATH, so agents installed where only config.fish looks (`~/.local/bin` for omp and claude) failed with "command not found" and the session opened on an empty fish prompt.
/// Launch it from fish's `--init-command`, after config.fish has run, so the agent sees the user's real PATH and the same fish survives the agent. The startup (the prompt-editor setup and the agent command) still runs in the script shell as an interactive login shell (`zsh -lic`, as before this change) because launch commands and custom agent commands are POSIX syntax and may rely on aliases or variables from the user's zsh profiles; the agent therefore keeps everything it had before and only gains fish's PATH. The setup must run there, after config.fish and .zshrc, not before `exec fish`: a config.fish that sets EDITOR or VISUAL (`set -x VISUAL code`) otherwise replaced Ghostex's prompt-editor wrapper, so a chat send that opened the agent's external editor launched VS Code and the agent waited on "Save and close editor to continue...". The startup travels in an environment variable that fish removes before running it, so no quoting crosses the two shells.
/// SEE-ALSO: server/src/zmx/zsh_startup.rs starts zsh users' agents from the first precmd for the same reason.
