CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-08-01:
Reads the CURRENT model / reasoning effort from agent-owned structured
transcript metadata and the session's terminal scrollback, plus Claude's
current permission mode from its footer, so the composer's option pills show
evidence instead of a catalog guess.

The agent TUIs render their state into a statusline (Claude Code) or a footer
(Codex). `zmx history` already returns that text (the live screen is part of
the history output), so detection is one bounded process spawn — no new
protocol, no agent cooperation.

Matching is SEGMENT-EXACT and case-sensitive: each scanned line is split on the
statusline delimiters (`|` for Claude's custom statusline, `·` for Codex's
footer), every segment is trimmed, and a segment only counts when the WHOLE
segment matches the grammar. Prose can therefore never false-match (an
assistant sentence mentioning "high" is one long segment), and the Codex
session title is excluded by the grammar itself.

CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-09-03 WHY:
Codex's footer is a user-ordered list (`tui.status_line`), so NO segment
position carries meaning. An earlier "the first segment is the title" skip
threw away `gpt-5.6-sol high` on every config that lists
`model-with-reasoning` first, leaving the pills empty until the first turn's
transcript record. The whole-segment grammar is the only guard; a title would
have to be exactly `<model id> <effort>` to be mistaken for one.

Terminal evidence wins per option because it can reflect an idle `/model`
change before the next response. The latest Claude assistant / Codex
turn-context record fills any missing value. Nothing matched ⇒ `None` ⇒ the
field is omitted from results/frames. There is deliberately no guessing.
