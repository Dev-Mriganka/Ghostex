Why a send did not complete. The message a caller shows the user is the same as
before; what is new is that the caller can tell "the terminal refused this
message" (the agent CLI in the pane never answered the Ctrl+G handshake, or zmx
would not take the bytes — the crashed-agent case this feature exists to
explain) apart from "this send was never attempted" (superseded by a newer send,
cancelled, or the queue was gone). Only the former is evidence about the
terminal, so only the former may raise a notice.

/*
Invariant preserved from the upstream chat spec: each sequence owns the input line from its
clear until its Enter fires. One worker task per session drains jobs
serially; a cancelled generation skips queued jobs at dequeue AND aborts the
remaining steps of an in-flight job before its next write/sleep. A failed
zmx write aborts the rest of its sequence so a dangling Enter can never
follow a body that was not delivered. Must be called from within the tokio
runtime (HTTP handlers are).

CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-24:
"Each sequence owns the input line" only holds if EVERY server-side writer to
that pty goes through here. Until this date several did not — the first-prompt
auto-title job, the manual "generate name" job (which writes a Ctrl+U draft
kill!), delayed sends, the raw `/api/sendSessionText` + `/api/sendSessionEnter`
endpoints, and the draft-handoff BEL — and they interleaved with in-flight send
sequences (measured: an auto-title write landed 70ms after a corrupted send,
because the auto-title job is triggered by the FIRST user prompt, i.e. exactly
while that prompt is still being delivered). They all enqueue now, and a writer
whose bytes must not be split apart (text → settle → Enter) enqueues them as ONE
job, because separate jobs may be separated by somebody else's job.
