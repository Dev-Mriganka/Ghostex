/// User: pressing Enter in the chat must always send, clearing whatever is blocking the message first. Claude Code 2.1.281 opened its "LSP plugin recommendation" over the input box and every send came back until the user switched to the terminal. Claude opens these offers by itself, so the send presses Escape and then types the message. Claude's source answers Escape with "No, not now" (LSP), "No" (plugin hints), "Never mind" (Remote Control) or closes the notice (API spend), so nothing is installed, enabled or turned off.
/// WHY: matched by exact title and rows, never by panel shape: Escape on a permission prompt rejects the tool call and on the trust dialog exits Claude, so a panel that is not listed here still refuses the send.
