CDXC:Sessions 2026-09-12 WHY:
Snooze used to keep `snoozedUntil` for a day after the wake time so a Sidebar V2 "Woke" indicator could read it; that
inbox never shipped its UI. The sidebar's Snoozed section now needs a presentation delta when the wake time passes,
because nothing on the client re-partitions sections on a timer: the sweep clearing the spent snooze at the boundary
is that delta. Clients still classify by the clock, so the row leaves the section at the wake time to the millisecond
and the sweep's minute of slack only affects the stored fields.

The configuration channel. gxserver already reads the shared sidebar settings
file for `debuggingMode` (see `logging/logger.rs`), and both `sidebarVersion` and
`sidebarAutoSettleAfterDays` ride the same settings pipeline the Sidebar V2
toggle uses, so there is no new transport, no new endpoint, and no duplicated
source of truth. One read serves both keys.

Automatic settling is a Sidebar V2 concept: a V1 user has no settled shelf, so
a session the sweep parks would simply vanish from their sidebar with no way to
see or undo it. The window is therefore gated on `sidebarVersion == "v2"`;
missing file, missing key, or any other value means V1 and disables the pass.
The settle/snooze RPCs stay open regardless of version — remote machines and
mobile clients drive those explicitly, and only the AUTOMATIC pass is gated.

Within V2: missing key / unparseable value -> the default window. Explicit
`null` or a non-positive number -> auto-settle disabled, matching the client
predicate's `autoSettleAfterDays: null`.

CDXC:StateSync 2026-07-29:
The same settings read, answering the other question every Sidebar V2 server-side
data pass has to ask first: is this machine on V2 at all?

gxserver's git-status and `origin`-remote passes exist ONLY to fill Sidebar V2
surfaces (cards' branch/±/PR badge and cross-machine grouping). Ungated they cost
a V1 user permanent ambient load: git spawns per live session cwd and up to a
dozen `gh` NETWORK calls every minute, forever, for data nothing renders. So
they run exactly when auto-settle's window does: `sidebarVersion == "v2"`,
missing file / missing key / any other value means V1.

Callers must resolve this ONCE PER PASS rather than at task spawn, so flipping
the setting takes effect within one pass (~60s) without restarting the daemon.
