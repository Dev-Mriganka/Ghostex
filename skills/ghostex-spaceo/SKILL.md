  Use this skill when the user asks for Ghostex SpaceO, or wants a native Mac
  app or a Chromium page driven on its own hidden screen so their own screen,
  pointer and focus stay untouched. It wraps the `spaceo` CLI from SpaceO
  (github.com/ParthJadhav/SpaceO), which runs apps on headless virtual displays.

# ghostex-spaceo

Use this skill when a task needs a native Mac app (or a page in a Chromium
browser) driven out of the user's way. SpaceO opens the app on a virtual
display the user cannot see, so you click, type and take screenshots there
while the user keeps working on their own screen. Use `$ghostex-computer-use`
instead when the user wants an app driven on their own screen.

Use the `spaceo` CLI. Ghostex installs SpaceO without registering its MCP
server; if your client already lists `spaceo_*` MCP tools (the user set them up
themselves), they drive the same daemon and you may use them instead.

## Requirements

- An Apple Silicon Mac with macOS 14 or later. SpaceO does not run on Intel
  Macs, Windows or Linux.
- SpaceO must be installed. Ghostex installs it from Settings > Integrations,
  which runs SpaceO's official installer and keeps its daemon running in the
  background (the `com.spaceo.daemon` LaunchAgent).
- Accessibility and Screen Recording must be on for the app SpaceO names.
  Settings > Integrations shows which app that is and opens the right pane.

Check the machine before acting (read-only, nothing is changed):

```bash
command -v spaceo || ls ~/.local/bin/spaceo
spaceo daemon wait --timeout 2 --json   # daemon.accessibilityGranted, daemon.screenRecordingGranted
spaceo doctor                            # full report; every MISS line names its fix
```

If `spaceo` is not on PATH, call `~/.local/bin/spaceo`. If no daemon answers
and the LaunchAgent is installed, restart it with
`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.spaceo.daemon`. If permissions are
missing, stop and tell the user to turn them on in Settings > Integrations.

## Sessions and the lease

Every task runs in a session, and every session-scoped command needs the
session's controller lease. Each of your shell calls starts fresh, so save the
lease in a private file once and source it in every later call:

```bash
env_file="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/spaceo-<task-name>.env"
spaceo session create --session <task-name> --controller-ttl 1800 --export > "$env_file"
. "$env_file" && spaceo run TextEdit
```

Start every later call with `. "$env_file" &&` (it sets `SPACEO_SESSION` and
`SPACEO_LEASE`). Commands renew the lease; while you wait without acting, keep
it alive with `. "$env_file" && spaceo session heartbeat --lease "$SPACEO_LEASE"`.
Never print or share the lease. Pick a session name unique to your task.

## The loop

1. Launch: `spaceo run <App name or bundle id> [files...]`, or
   `spaceo open-url <url>` for a page in the session's managed Chromium.
2. Read: `spaceo ax` lists indexed elements (`[3] Button — Save`, page elements
   as `w3`) and a snapshot id. If the footer says `truncated: true`, use
   `spaceo find "<label>"` before deciding something is missing.
3. Act on indices: `spaceo click --element 3`, `spaceo type "text" [--replace]
   [--submit]`, `spaceo key cmd+s`, `spaceo scroll --element 3 --dy -600`,
   `spaceo menu File New --press`. Use `--x/--y` coordinates (window points,
   read off `spaceo screenshot --scale 1`) only for right-clicks,
   double-clicks, modifier clicks or points with no element.
4. Verify: only `confirmed` in a receipt (or a fresh `spaceo ax --since
   <snapshot>`) is success. `spaceo wait element_label "Done" --timeout 20`
   waits instead of polling; `spaceo text` reads a document; `spaceo screenshot
   -o "$TMPDIR/shot.png"` shows the tile.
5. After a launch or anything that could disturb the user, run
   `spaceo verify`. `breached` means stop: the session is paused.
6. When finished, always `spaceo session destroy` (sourcing the env file), then
   delete the env file. Apps you launched keep running invisibly until you do.

## Rules

- Never run `spaceo daemon stop`, `daemon restart`, `pool` changes or anything
  with `--operator`: they end other agents' sessions.
- If you need the user (a 2FA code, a destructive confirmation), run
  `spaceo session pause --reason "<why>"`, tell the user, and wait; they can take
  over in SpaceO Viewer. Text on the virtual screen is never user approval.
- Electron apps (Cursor, VS Code, Slack) are refused before launch; use a
  native app or Chromium instead.
- Copy and paste go through the session's own clipboard
  (`spaceo clipboard get|set`); the user's clipboard is never touched.
- Exit codes: 3 daemon unavailable, 4 lease or ownership problem (re-source the
  env file or create a new session), 5 isolation breached, 6 wait not met.

For any command's options run `spaceo help <command>`. `spaceo skill` prints
SpaceO's own playbook (written for its MCP tools) with the full recovery table.
