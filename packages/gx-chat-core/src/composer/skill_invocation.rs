//! How each agent spells a skill invocation: in the `$` picker's rows, in the composer's skill pill,
//! and in the text the agent receives.
//!
//! CDXC:AgentSkills 2026-09-27 DECISION:
//! User: "let's invoke skills in claude code like /skill-name" and "for codex the actual way to invoke skills is just $", and the skill pill in the GPUI and React Native composers shows that spelling. A Claude agent handed `[$cua-driver](…/SKILL.md)` answered that the skill only loads from the slash command itself, "without the link or `$`". So a Claude draft keeps a `[/name](…/SKILL.md)` link (that is what makes it a pill) and Claude receives the bare `/name`; Codex keeps the `[$name](…/SKILL.md)` link its own composer writes. The `$` key still opens the picker for every agent.
//! SEE-ALSO: `server/src/session_chat_skill_invocation.rs` types the same bare `/name` into Claude's terminal; both sides must convert exactly the same links, or the optimistic echo stops matching the turn Claude records.
