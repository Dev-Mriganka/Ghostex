CDXC:Worktrees 2026-07-29:
Sidebar V2's worktree flow. A worktree is an ATTRIBUTE of a session (its cwd
plus branch), not a registered sibling project, so ONE call creates the
checkout and the session that lives in it, atomically, server-side.

Contract rules the emitter and every client agree on:
- `projectId` is the PARENT project the worktree is cut from. gxserver derives
  the checkout path, the temp branch (`ghostex/<8hex>`), and the setup command
  from that project; the client never sends paths it invented.
- `baseBranch` omitted means the repository's default branch. `startFromOrigin`
  asks gxserver to fetch first and branch from `origin/<baseBranch>` instead of
  the local ref, so a stale local branch cannot silently seed the worktree.
- `existingWorktree.path` SKIPS creation entirely and spawns the session inside
  that checkout. The path must come from gxserver's own worktree list (or an
  existing session's cwd); gxserver re-validates and normalizes it.
- `firstPrompt` is optional. Without it the session starts idle in the agent,
  exactly like a plain agent launch with no prompt.
- The whole sequence rolls back (worktree removed) if any step fails, so a
  failed call leaves no half-made checkout behind.

CDXC:Drafts 2026-08-28:
Agent switching is DRAFTS ONLY. A draft has no conversation, so swapping its
agent needs no confirmation and loses nothing: gxserver kills the draft's
background CLI, clears the session's agent identity, rebuilds its launch plan
with the same resolution `/api/createAgentSession` uses, and starts the new
agent's CLI. The call is refused with `invalidState` once the session has been
promoted (its first user prompt reached the agent), because at that point the
transcript, the resume plan, and the session's agent identity all belong to the
agent that produced them.

`agentId` is a visible sidebar project agent whose base family is
chat-supported. Clients read the allowed set from `availableAgents` on
`/api/readSessionChat` rather than building it themselves.

  extending them (used when a tab closes, so the session becomes sleepable again
