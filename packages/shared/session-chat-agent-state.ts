Rows of an on-screen picker the chat surface can ANSWER, rather than only point
at — Claude Code's resume-usage chooser ("Resume from summary" / "Resume full
session as-is" / "Don't ask me again"), which owns the CLI's input line after a
large session is resumed and whose Enter CONFIRMS a row, so a chat message
delivered into it silently compacts the conversation it was meant to continue.

A notice that carries these renders the same option rows as the AskUserQuestion
card, and the pick goes back through answerSessionChatPrompt's `terminalChoice`
lane. `selected` is where the TUI highlight sat AT DETECTION TIME: shown as the
CLI's own default, never used to compute keystrokes, because the highlight can
move between the detection and the answer.

renders the notice as title + detail + "Open terminal" — exactly what this

Live work the agent CLI reports on its terminal before transcript JSONL catches
up. `agent-stream` is the `⏺ …` message Claude is writing right now: `text`
carries the whole block as painted so far (stitched across probes once the
bullet scrolls off the full-screen grid; `label` is its first paragraph), and
the client shows it as the streaming assistant bubble until the transcript
carries the same text (packages/gx-chat-core/src/session/terminal.rs). `claude-status` is an
allowlisted star-marker line and becomes transient reasoning history in the
client; `claude-tool` is the row above a `⎿` output gutter, i.e. a tool call,
shown as a pending tool row at the bottom of the transcript and never in the
working strip; `shells-running` remains one bottom activity
row only while Claude shows its background-shell status; `compacting` is
structured progress:

    ✶ Compacting conversation… (1m 1s)
      ████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 49%

Deliberately NOT a `terminalNotice`: nothing is wrong, nothing is blocked, and
there is nothing to answer. Both variants render in the transcript.

`percent` and `elapsedSeconds` are read off the screen or omitted; a client must
never estimate them. `detectedAt` is the anchor for a smoothly ticking local
clock: it belongs to the RUN, not the sample, so it holds still while the
numbers move. Carried by read results and by snapshot/replaced/state frames with
`prompt` semantics — an omitted field means CLEARED, which is how a client
learns the work finished.

Slash commands GHOSTEX typed into the agent without the composer:
provider-specific first-prompt auto-title jobs and the rename modal stage
`/rename <title>` (Pi `/name`, Hermes Agent `/title`), while forks
submit a provisional `Fork: <old title>`.

Claude Code records everything it intercepts, so its transcript already carries
those sends. Codex records NOTHING, and a session that renamed itself mid-thread
left no trace in chat at all — the reader saw the title change with no
explanation. These rows are the app saying what it did.

They are an ACKNOWLEDGEMENT with a short server-side TTL, never history: a
client drops one as soon as it finds the agent's own record of the same command,
so the two never both render, and nothing is persisted. Unlike `prompt` /
`terminalNotice`, an omitted field does NOT mean cleared — the rows retire on
their own schedule, so a frame with nothing to add stays silent instead of
racing the client into dropping one it should still show.
